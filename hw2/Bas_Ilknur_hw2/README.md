`HW2:` MEDIAN STRING SEARCH

In order to compile this, do the following in Terminal when the current directory is this folder. In addition, please note that, I have not included any .fa file inside my zip folder for the testing purposes.

Also, theoretically Knuth-Morris-Pratt should be the best algorithm since it is O(m+n).
Both the comparison number and runtime should be considered when we are deciding the best algorithm   

$make
$./hw2 -i T.fa -p P.fa
